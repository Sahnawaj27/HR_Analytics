I am thrilled to share that I have recently wrapped up an extensive Power BI project that involved working with data of an organization.

The object is to help an organization to improve employee performance and find reason of attrition by creating a dashboard.

Emphasizing the delivery of actionable insights and significant visual representations, this project involved multiple stages such as data cleansing, utilizing query editor, employing DAX functions, and crafting impactful charts for visualization.

üìä Project Approach:

1. Data Cleaning through Query Editor: The initial and essential phase involved guaranteeing the integrity and consistency of the data. In the Power Query Editor, various transformation techniques were utilized, including the removal of duplicates, addressing missing values, and standardizing formats. This thorough cleaning process established a robust basis for precise and dependable analysis.

2. Unleashing the DAX Functions: To obtain meaningful insights, the DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) function is employed.

3. Presenting the insights through impactful charts: To ascertain insights, visualizations were meticulously crafted to enhance straightforward interpretation and facilitate decision-making.



üîç Key Insights:

-- A predominant number of departing employees come from a background in Life Science, followed by those with medical and marketing backgrounds.

-- The highest count of employees leaving the company falls within the age range of 26-35 years.

-- The roles with the highest attrition rates include laboratory technician, sales executive, and research scientist.

-- The majority of employees who left the company had a monthly salary below the average salary.

-- Employees departing from the company are notably higher after spending 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years in their respective tenures.

-- Based on the travel history, individuals who infrequently engage in travel are more likely to leave the company in significant numbers.
